#Administrator documentation **["CORE ONLY"]**

Writing a new techncial document can take time. This is especially so when you are using many different kinds 
software for your current the project. The project mananager is using their own software the manange the budget 
and timeline. I am using one software to mind map my meeting with the end user and collect all the information 
on the process. Then I use another software that is at my disposal to type the process out. Next I use another 
kind of software for version control. This process gets very confusing, very quickly!

Girl, just use GitLab! Stop the storm in your head with all the different windows open on your computer and just 
use one software from now on!
